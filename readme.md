# Minimal Websocket & Flask app
**Status:** Abandoned  
**Runtime environment:** macOS, Python 3.8.1

## About
Learning to use HTML/CSS/JS as front-end for Python apps, this mini project tries to use Websocket 
and Flask as back-end.  

Turns out that it will most likely not work like I imagined, so I am abandoning this mini project.
There are other socket io packages that works with Flask, but for what I want to use it as it
will just make the apps to complicated. One of the reasons I wanted to try implement Flask 
was to use it as a shortcut - so I could just point to localhost instead of a file in the
browser, and avoid cross-platform issues with the file path. But I think it is better to 
just make a method to handle cross-platform file paths when needed.
